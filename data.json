How about you?\n  [0:20] Alex: I'm doing well, thanks. So, what have you been up to lately?\n  [0:25] Sarah: Oh, you know, the usual grind. Work has been keeping me busy. But I did manage to take a short trip to the mountains last month. It was so refreshing.\n  [0:35] Alex: That sounds amazing! I've been meaning to plan a trip myself. Maybe we should go together sometime.\n [0:42] Sarah: That would be fantastic! We should definitely plan something soon.\n  [0:48] Alex: Absolutely. So, have you heard from any of our other friends lately?\n  [0:54] Sarah: Yeah, I bumped into Lisa last week. She's doing great. And I think Tom is planning to visit next month. It'll be nice to catch up with everyone.\n  [1:03] Alex: Definitely. It's been too long since we've all been together. Hey, speaking of catching up, have you seen the latest season of that show we used to watch?\n  [1:12] Sarah: Oh, yes! I binge-watched it last weekend. It was so good! I couldn't stop watching.\n  [1:20] Alex: Right? I was hooked from the first episode. We'll have to discuss all the plot twists sometime.\n  [1:28] Sarah: Definitely! We should plan a virtual watch party or something.\n  [1:35] Alex: That's a great idea! We can schedule it for next weekend if you're free.\n  [1:42] Sarah: Sounds perfect. I'll check my calendar and let you know.\n  [1:48] Alex: Great. So, how's everything else going in your life?\n  [1:54] Sarah: Overall, things are good. Just trying to stay positive and take things one day at a time, you know?\n  [2:02] Alex: I hear you. It's been a challenging year for everyone. But I'm glad to hear you're staying positive.\n  [2:10] Sarah: Thanks, Alex. And how about you? How have you been coping?\n  [2:15] Alex: It's had its ups and downs, but I'm managing. Having supportive friends like you definitely helps.\n  [2:23] Sarah: Aw, thanks, Alex. You know I'm always here for you.\n  [2:28] Alex: I appreciate that, Sarah. Well, it's been great catching up, but I should probably get going now.\n  [2:35] Sarah: Yeah, same here. Let's plan that virtual watch party and catch up again soon.\n  [2:42] Alex: Definitely. Take care, Sarah. \n  [2:47] Sarah: You too, Alex. Talk to you later. Bye! \n  [2:53] Alex: Bye! \n  [2:55] [They hang up]"

I see your claim here. It looks like the nursing charges and administrative charges were not reimbursed. According to your policy, administrative charges are not eligible for reimbursement.\n[2023-07-18 00:00:58 AM]Customer: I understand the policy regarding administrative charges, but the nursing charges were essential for my recovery.

Why weren't those charges covered?\n[2023-07-18 00:01:08 AM]Agent: As per your policy, nursing charges are only reimbursed if they are provided in a hospital setting.

I hope we can find a resolution to this issue soon.\n[2023-07-18 00:02:14 AM]Agent: Absolutely, I understand the importance of finding a resolution.
